    <h2>Community Build</h2>
    <p>
      Featuring equipment for active, social, and self-directed play,
      the park serves as a significant buffer against the adjacent lanes
      of the Massaschussetts turnpike. John Hancock Financial covered the costs
      of the development of the park, and donated it to the city upon completion.
